# My First Game: Space Invaders

## Description

As part of my Software Engineering Program through Per Scholas, during the 6 week milestone, I have been tasked with creating a game. The game I have chosen to build is Space Invaders. I chose this game because it was one of the first video games I learned to play and have loved it since!
